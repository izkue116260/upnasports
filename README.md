# Pleasure Static Site Generator
> Twig based Static Site generator powered by gulp.

## Motivation
There are a lot of static site generator out there but we always found ourselves tweaking and adjusting them.
The idea is to use it as a boiler plate for basic static web sites. Tailored to our needs and workflows, its intended to use as it is with no config required.
Heavily inspired on Jekyll.
